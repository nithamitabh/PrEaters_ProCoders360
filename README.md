## Introduction
If we can pre-book hotels and taxis then why not food.
Time is the most precious asset that we have. But we do spend a lot of time waiting for the waiter at the restaurant to get our order and then place it on our table. We intend to solve this issue.

## About
In this project, we aim to interconnect customers to the restaurants where the customer side can pre-book their meal and the restaurant side is ready to serve them on exact time which leads to easy management as well as less time wastage. If the restaurants already know about the orders they are going to get this will prevent food wastage. Our website will also keep a track of the number of tables available in the following restaurant so that customers may not waste time going to restaurants that are already occupied. Also, this website will help restaurants provide good services. For all the development we used CSS, PHP, scss, javascript, hack.

## Business aspect
PREATERS aims to transform the restaurant menus into a more accessible, much easier-to-use website. Customers can make payments and share reviews based on their experience. PREATERS allows restaurants to be visible to their target group. Our mission is to add every single restaurant be it big companies like Mcd, KFC, or small restaurants present on the streets.Introduction
